          <pre id="s2v1">BMC Cardiovascular Disorders 2007, 7:9 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2261/7/9The records of 1639 patients managed by specialist heart failure services were screened, of which997 (61%) were ineligible, due to ejection fraction&gt;40%, current NYHA IV, no admission or NYHAII or more within the previous 2 years, or serious co-morbidities preventing physical activity. 642patients were contacted: 289 (45%) declined to participate, 183 (39%) had an exclusion criterionand 169 (26%) agreed to randomisation.Discussion: Due to safety considerations for home-exercise less than half of patients treated byspecialist  heart  failure  services  were  eligible  for  the  study.  Many  patients  had  co-morbiditiespreventing exercise and others had concerns about undertaking an exercise programme.BackgroundHeart failure is a major cause of morbidity and mortalityin  westernised  societies  and  has  a  poor  prognosis  [1-3]Patients  with  heart  failure  (HF)  suffer  from  a  variety  ofsymptoms,  many  of  which  are  non-specific  and  oftenresult in a poor quality of life[4], with decreased exercisecapacity being the main factor restricting daily activity.Heart failure management in the UK is currently undergo-ing major changes as a result of evidence showing the ben-efits  of  specialist  nurses  in  reducing  hospitalreadmissions[5,6]  Specialist  heart  failure  nurses  fundedboth by the British Heart Foundation and by local primarycare trusts are becoming part of the accepted standard ofcare for patients with heart failure. Specialist heart failurenurses  do  not  currently provide  structured  exercise  train-ing[6,7].Effectiveness of exercise rehabilitationFour  systematic  reviews  have  addressed  the  effectivenessof exercise training for patients with heart failure [8-11]. Aqualitative review in 2002 concluded that short-term exer-cise  training  in  selected  sub-groups  of  patients  led  toshort-term improvements on quality of life and had somephysiological  benefits[8].  However,  it  was  noted  thatmost  trials  were  of  short  duration,  small  scale  andfocussed on physiological changes rather than morbidityand  mortality.  They  also  had  included  a  patient  profilethat is not representative of typical heart failure patients,being younger, predominantly male and without co-mor-bidities[8].A  Cochrane  review  which  included  1126  patients  in  29randomised  controlled  trials  (RCT)  concluded  that  forpatients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) class IIor  III  heart  failure,  exercise  training  improved  exercisecapacity  and  quality  of  life  in  the  short-term.  Improve-ments in exercise capacity were greater in programmes ofgreater intensity and longer duration[10]. One study[11]using  an  end  point  of  combined  events  and  mortalityfound no difference in combined events (death or adverseevents)  in  the  exercise  group  (OR  0.98;  95%  CI  0.61  to1.32) compared to the control group. There was a non-sig-nificant trend towards a reduction in mortality (OR 0.71; 95% CI 0.37 to 1.02, p = 0.06)[11]. The ExTraMATCH col-laboration  undertook  an  individual  patient  data  meta-analysis by combining the datasets from eight RCTs witha total of 801 patients[9]. This had access to longer-termfollow-up  data  than  was  available  to  the  previous  meta-analyses and showed an overall reduction in mortality inthe  patients  who  received  the  exercise  intervention  (haz-ard ratio 0.65; 95% CI 0.42 to 0.92)[9].Only one trial has compared exercise training in patientswith  a  control  group  receiving  a  specialist  heart  failurenurse intervention[12]. This evaluated an eight-week hos-pital  rehabilitation  programme  including  exercise  andeducation  followed  by  a  16  week community  supervisedexercise  programme  in  patients  referred  to  a  specialistheart failure nurse and reported significant improvementsat 24 week follow-up in the Minnesota Living with HeartFailure Questionnaire (MLwHF) and EuroQol scores, theNew  York  Heart  Association  (NYHA)  class  and  distancewalked on  the  6-minute  walk  between  the rehabilitationand specialist heart failure nurse care only[12]. The exer-cise intervention occurred at the same time as medicationwas  optimised  and  there  was  a  higher  proportion  ofpatients in the intervention arm on beta-blockade, whichmay  have  accounted  for  some  of  the  difference.  In  addi-tion  the  rehabilitation  programme  included  an  educa-tional component and was not solely exercise-based.Mechanism of action of exerciseThe majority of trials of exercise in patients with heart fail-ure have reported physiological improvements, which aremainly  due  to  peripheral  adaptations  [13-18]  There  issome  evidence  that  exercise  increases  cardiac  stroke  vol-ume[16,19-21]  and  reduces  cardiomegaly[16].  Exercisetraining  has  been  shown  to  lower  resting  heart  rate  andimprove  myocardial  perfusion[22].  The  mechanisms  ofthese  actions  include  an  improvement  in  the  neurohor-monal abnormalities seen in heart failure, enhanced vagaltone,  and  changes  in  skeletal  muscle  type  and  function[13]. Favourable changes in the indices of heart rate vari-ability  have  been  reported,  which  indicates  improvedautonomic  control  of  heart  rate  and  has  been  associatedwith  improved  survival[23].  However,  trials  of  exerciseinterventions  rarely  report  data  on  the  extent  to  whichPage 2 of 9(page number not for citation purposes)</pre>

Questions  remain  about  the  optimal  trainingmodality  and intensity[24] but current evidence  suggeststhat  training  should  include  aerobic  and  resistance  com-ponents. Peripheral muscles should be trained without asignificant  increase  in  cardiovascular  stress[25],  usingintermittent exercise and/or sequential training.Whilst the National Service Framework for coronary heartdisease suggests that cardiac rehabilitation should be con-sidered for patients with heart failure[26], it is rarely pro-vided  in  the  UK.  Indeed,  there  are  no  published  data  onthe  uptake  and  acceptability  of  exercise-based  rehabilita-tion for heart failure, but poor uptake post myocardial inf-arction (MI) occurs particularly in women, the elderly andpatients  from  minority  ethnic  groups  [27-31].  and  theprofile of patients with heart failure is older and includesmore  women  than  is  the  case  for  MI.  Only  one  entirelyhome-based  exercise  intervention  trial  (20  patients  inhome  arm)  has  been  reported,  with  significant  improve-ments  in  quality  of  life  compared  to  patients  receivingusual care[32].Rationale for Birmingham Rehabilitation Uptake Maximisation study for patients with congestive heart failure (BRUM-CHF) studyWhilst  there  are  a  number  of  very  small  trials  of  exerciseinterventions  for  patients  with  heart  failure,  questionsremain  about  the  effectiveness  of  exercise  interventionsoutside  specialist  research  units  and  in  a  representativepatient  population[24].  The  follow-up  period  needed  tobe  of  sufficient  duration  to  measure hospital  admissionsand  mortality.  In  addition,  apart  from  one  trial[12],  thereported trials of exercise rehabilitation were all comparedto 'usual care'. The latter provided in these control arms isinferior  to  the  specialist  heart  failure  nurse  interventionnow offered as part of modern heart failure managementprogrammes. There is also no evidence as to whether theimprovements in quality of life and mortality in the exer-cise intervention groups in the published trials, are a resultof physiological improvements or from the close clinicalmonitoring received alongside the exercise. It may also bethat lifestyle  and  drug  management advice was impartedwith  the  exercise  intervention  and  these  improvementswould  now  result  from  the  specialist  nurse  intervention.The  cost-effectiveness  of  exercise  interventions  has  beenaddressed by only one study[33], which had usual care asthe control group. This concluded that a long-term hospi- tal-based exercise programme for people with stable heartfailure was a cost-effective intervention[33].The  BRUM-CHF  study  proposes  to  establish  the  addi-tional benefits of exercise rehabilitation compared to cur-rent  care  that  includes  specialist  heart  failure  nurses.Given the potential problems with the capacity of the hos-pital service and uptake in a more elderly and debilitatedpopulation than other patients receiving cardiac rehabili-tation for MI or revascularisation, it will be important tohave information about effectiveness, uptake and compli-ance in a predominantly home-based setting.Study aimThe  primary  research  question  seeks  to  evaluate  whetherthere  are  additional  benefits  from  exercise  rehabilitationover  specialist  heart  failure  nurse  management  and  toestablish the cost-effectiveness and patient acceptability ofa  predominantly  home-based  programme  of  exerciserehabilitation.  In  addition,  the  study  will  investigate  thepatient  experience  of  heart  failure  and  rehabilitationwhilst  attaining  information  about  effectiveness,  uptakeand  compliance  of  patients  in  a  predominantly  home-based setting.Methods/DesignBRUM-CHF  is  a  randomised  controlled  trial  of  exerciserehabilitation  in  heart  failure  comparing  specialist  heartfailure nurse care alone with specialist heart failure nursecare plus a structured exercise intervention.Prior to commencement of the study, ethical approval wasobtained  from  Sandwell  and  West  Birmingham  LocalResearch  Ethics  Committee  (Reference  number:  03/10/708).Randomisation  was  performed  centrally  by  computer  atthe Birmingham Cancer Clinical Trials Unit, University ofBirmingham. When a patient was identified as eligible forthe study, and had given written, informed consent to takepart, the research nurse telephoned the trials unit. The Tri-als Unit randomly allocated patients, using the method ofminimisation, stratified by (i) NYHA group, (ii) presenceor absence of atrial fibrillation and (iii) hospital site.In  one  arm  patients  continued  with  &quot;usual&quot;  specialistheart failure nurse care. In the other arm patients contin-ued  with  &quot;usual&quot;  specialist  heart  failure  nurse  care  com-bined  with  the  exercise  programme.  The  trial  design  issummarised in Figure 1. Patients who refused randomisa-tion continued with their normal specialist nurse care.PopulationThe two NHS hospital Trusts and one Primary Care Trustfrom  which  patients  were  recruited  are  in  the  West  Mid-Page 3 of 9(page number not for citation purposes)</pre>

Recruited patients had left ventricular systo-lic  dysfunction  with  an  ejection  fraction  of  40%  or  lessmeasured quantitatively, or classed qualitatively as 'mod-erate  to  severe  impairment'  on  an  echocardiogram,  andwere  identified  from  three  specialist  heart  failure  nurseservices.  Recruitment  took  place  over  19  months.  Inclu-sion and exclusion criteria are summarised in Table 1.Details of all patients referred to the specialist heart failureservices were collected and suitability for study participa-tion  identified.  Potentially  eligible  patients  were  con-tacted,  invited  to  participate  and  assessed  prior  torandomisation by an incremental shuttle walk test (ISWT)to  determine  their  suitability  for  exercise  and  to  excludepatients  with  symptomatic  ischaemia,  cardiac  arrhyth-mias or marked hypotension on exercise[34,35].Baseline  data  collected  prior  to  randomisation  includedthe NYHA class, left ventricular systolic ejection fraction,demographic  details  (age,  sex,  ethnicity),  disease  history(admissions  for  heart  failure)  and  past  medical  history,current medication, and outcomes (see below).InterventionsSpecialist heart failure nurse care&quot;Usual  care&quot;  is  that  provided  by  primary  and  secondarycare  with  specialist  heart  failure  nurse  input.  To  ensurehomogeneity  of  the  intervention  received,  especially  inrelation to heart failure nurse input and receipt of optimalmedical  treatment,  patients  were  recruited  from  thosereferred to the specialist heart failure clinic. The heart fail-ure  nurses  had  all  undergone  training  from  the  BritishHeart Foundation. Exercise interventionThe  exercise  group  received  &quot;usual  care&quot;  as  describedabove,  plus  an  exercise  programme  which  commencedwith  three  supervised  exercise  sessions  to  provide  thepatient  with  confidence  and  to  plan  an  individualisedexercise programme. This was followed by a home-basedprogramme with home visits at 4, 10 and 20 weeks, tele-phone support at 6, 15 and 24 weeks and a manual.The  home  programme  was  predominantly  aerobic  train-ing based largely on progressive walking with self-comple-tion  activity  logs.  Exercise  prescription  was  based  uponthe  participant's  baseline  exercise  tolerance  as  measuredby  the  incremental  shuttle  walking  test.  Performance  onthis test correlates well with peak VO2 [34,36] An individ-ually prescribed walking programme was identified fromthis test at a speed that corresponded to 70% of peak per-formance. During the first two weeks of rehabilitation thespeed of walking was secured by the patient with the helpof the rehabilitation team. Targets were set weekly for theduration and frequency of walks, which largely dependedon  an  individual's  baseline  exercise  capacity.  The  pro-gramme  aimed  for  the  patients  to  achieve  20  to  30  min-utes  of  walking  5  times  a  week  after  10  weeks  ofrehabilitation.  This  was  monitored  with  home  trainingdiaries.Strength  training  was  low  intensity,  using  the  patient'sown body weight for resistance. The focus of the strengthtraining was both upper and lower limb. The &quot;milk bottleregime&quot; currently used in the rehabilitation programme inLeicester are used. Patients complete sets of up to 10 rep-etitions  of  8  key  exercise  using  milk  bottles  filled  withgradually increasing volumes (thus weights) of water.

Secondary  outcome  measures  at  6  months  are(i) composite of death or admission with heart failure ormyocardial  infarction,  (ii)  admission  with  heart  failure,(iii) mortality (all-cause and vascular), (iv) EuroQol[38],(v)  HADS[39],  (vi)  blood  pressure,  (vii)  self-reportedphysical  activity,  and  (viii)  distance  walked  on  theISWT[36].  At  12  months  the  ISWT  and  blood  pressuremeasurements are omitted.Process measures to determine the comparability of inter-vention  received  from  the  specialist  heart  failure  serviceincluded  self-reported  smoking  cessation,  salt  reductionand alcohol intake. Uptake and adherence to the exerciseintervention are assessed by (i) attendance at the hospitaltraining sessions, and (ii) patient completed exercise dia-ries at 4, 10 and 20 weeks in the intervention group.The study could not be double blind because of the natureof  the  intervention.  To  reduce  the  potential  for  bias  inmeasuring  outcomes  in  the  questionnaires  we  used  vali-dated measurement tools and aimed for clinical follow-upto be undertaken by an individual who had not providedthe  rehabilitation  support  and  was  blinded  to  treatmentallocation.  Determination  of  secondary  end-points  (hos-pitalisation  for  heart  failure  and  vascular  mortality)  wasby an independent committee blinded to treatment allo-cation.Sample SizeThe overall power of the trial was determined on the basisof the primary outcome – health related quality of life.To  detect  a  10  point  difference  between  the  'usual  care'and supervised exercise group on the MLwHFQ (13 pointsat  1  year  in  Belardinelli)[22]  at  the  5%  significance  levelwith  80%  power,  140  evaluable  subjects  at  1  year  wereneeded. Allowing for 20% mortality and loss to follow-upa total of 168 recruits (84 per group) were needed. Statistical analysisAll  data  will  be  analysed  by  intention  to  treat.  Compari-sons between the primary outcome measure will be madeat two separate time points: 6 months and 1 year to assessboth short and long-term effects of the exercise interven-tion.For  outcomes  measured  on  a  continuous  scale  (MLwHFquestionnaire,  HADS,  Euroqol,  blood  pressure,  self-reported physical activity, distance walked on ISWT), dif-ferences between the two groups will be investigated usinga least squares regression framework. Differences in timerelated  clinical  outcomes  (hospital  readmission  rates,mortality and composite of these) will be analysed usingthe  Kaplan-Meier  survival  method  and  the  two  groupscompared  by  the  Log-Rank  test.  Multivariate  regressionmethods  will  be  used  to  take  into  account  the  baselinemeasurements  for  each  patient.  When  baseline  informa-tion  is  available  this  provides  a  more  precise  estimate  ofthe  treatment  effect  than  either  raw  outcomes  or  changescores[40].  Results  will  be  expressed  as  means  and  95%confidence intervals.Qualitative studyThe  qualitative  part  of  the  study  seeks  to  explore  whatpatients with heart failure understand about their condi-tion and what they think the role and potential outcomesof  exercise  are.  The  results  of  the  qualitative  study  willcomplement  and  contextualise  the  quantitative  findingse.g. people who do not take part may hold negative viewsabout  exercise  or  that  it  is  dangerous,  particularly  in  ahome environment.Interviews  will  be  sought  with  purposive  samples  of  (i)patients  who  declined  to  take  part  in  the  study,  shortlyafter they have been invited; (ii) patients and their carerswho  were  randomised  to  both  exercise  and  controlgroups:  during  the  exercise  programme  and  at  6  monthsafter recruitment.We will use a maximum variety sample that represents thebroadest range of social characteristics[41]. As the processof this type of research is iterative and reflexive it enablesrefinement of the course of enquiry in response to emerg-ing  findings  i.e.  new  ideas  mentioned  by  interviewedpatients  are  integrated  with  current  knowledge  as  theinterviews progress and are included in subsequent inter-views.  This  process  is  continued  until  interviewing  is  nolonger generating new concepts and interviewing stops atthis  stage  (i.e.  theoretical  saturation)[42].  To  reach  thisstage  it  is  generally  estimated  that  between  20  and  30interviews per group are necessary[43]. Page 6 of 9(page number not for citation purposes)</pre>

NHS  costs  willbe based on resource inputs (time with the exercise reha-bilitation nurse, travel time, drugs,  use of  NHS resourcesincluding any differences in hospital admissions linked toheart  failure)  costed  up  to  include  labour  and  overheadcosts. National average unit costs will be used with explo-ration  of  local  differences  in  sensitivity  analysis.  A  cost-effectiveness analysis will be undertaken based on the out-come measures described above, with particular emphasison  deriving  estimates  of  the  incremental  cost  per  QALY.Utility  values  will  be  based  on  the  EQ-5D  (or  EuroQol)and life years from the mortality analysis described above.Modelling will be used to extrapolate from the trial (bothin  time  and  by  unit  cost)  and  for  sensitivity  analyses.Resource  use  data  will  be  collected  as  part  of  the  overalldata collection procedures. Bootstrapping will be used toexplore differences in costs. Cost effectiveness results willbe presented in the form of acceptability curves.RecruitmentThe clinical notes of 1639 patients referred to the special-ist heart failure nurse services were reviewed. Of these 997(60.8%)  were  deemed  not  eligible,  or  had  an  exclusioncriterion  identifiable  from  the  records  (table  2).  468(50.4%) had not been of NYHA class II or III or admittedwith decompensated heart failure within the previous 24months,  or  had  an  ejection  fraction  greater  than  40%.  Afurther 153 (15.3%) had a cardiac exclusion criterion, 204(20.4%) a co-morbid condition precluding a home exer-cise programme.The  remaining  642  (39%)  of  patients  were  contacted  byletter  and  invited  to  participate  in  the  study  once  theirheart failure was stable, and they were on maximised beta-blocker therapy. At this stage a further 172 (10.5% of totalsample) were excluded and 284 (17.3%) declined to par-ticipate (figure 1).The remaining 186 (12% of all initially reviewed patients)agreed  to  participate  in  the  study,  2%  of  these  failed  toattend  the  assessment  or  changed  their  mind  at  assess-ment.  The  remaining  181  patients  all  gave  written  andinformed consent and were assessed by incremental shut-tle walk test for suitability before randomisation. We iden-tified  contraindication  to  home  exercise  in  12  of  theassessed patients at the ISWT. Overall, only 10% of all cur-rently  alive  patients  referred  to  the  three  heart  failurenurse  services  in  the  two  years  prior  to  commencing  thestudy and during the 19 months of recruitment were actu-ally randomised. DiscussionThe BRUM-CHF study is novel in its evaluation of a pre-dominantly  home-based,  structured  exercise  programmefor  patients  with  heart  failure  also  receiving  specialistheart  failure  nurse  support.  Recruitment  to  the  trial  hashighlighted  that  such  an  exercise  programme  will  beappropriate  for  a  minority  of  patients  with  heart  failure.The majority of patients seen by the specialist heart failureservice  were  not  eligible  for  the  trial,  due  to  factors  thatincluded insufficient or too severe disease severity or pre-clusion of safe home exercise. In addition, co-morbiditiesaccounted for large numbers of patients not being suitablefor  exercise.  The  older  age  of  patients  with  heart  failuremeans  that  there  will  be  a  high  level  of  co-morbidity,which  was  not  an  issue  in  previous  trials  of  highlyselected, atypical patients[8]. Poor recruitment to trials ofpatients  with  heart  failure  has  been  previously  reported,with a high proportion declining to participate when con-tacted[44]. A trial of a nurse-intervention in primary carein the UK recruited 36% of those invited, compared with26% of eligible patients in our study. Reasons for non-par-ticipation  given  included  a  perception  of  being  too  old,Table 2: Reasons for non-non-eligibility and exclusions from BRUM-CHF from case-note assessment in patients on specialist Heart Failure nurse case-loadsReason for exclusion/ineligibility n %Not eligible 468 46.9Co-morbidity 204 20.4Physically unable 124Cognitive dysfunction 38Airways disease 23Visual disability 11Malignancy 8Cardiac related 153 15.3Recent stent 1Severe aortic stenosis/abdominal aortic aneurysm 10Unstable HF, arrhythmias, NYHA IV 81Implantable cardiac device 19Awaiting cardiac procedure: CABG/transplant/MVR 4Recent cardiac rehabilitation 1Recent myocardial infarction 1Recent cardiac transplant 1HOCM 1Postural hypotension 1Still being titrated on beta-blocker therapy 33Miscellaneous 91 9.1Risk assessment – unsuitable for home-visits 21Unable to read or write 3Not living in area 46Transport difficulties with attending hospital 8Not contactable 9Other 4Unable to speak English 77 7.7Unable to recruit before study end 4 0.4Total 997 100Page 7 of 9(page number not for citation purposes)</pre>

This  is  an  issue  which  willneed to be considered when planning rehabilitation serv-ices for patients with heart failure.The  qualitative  study  is  being  undertaken  in  a  patientgroup  which  has  received  specialist  heart  failure  nursecare.  Previous  research  has  highlighted  the  low  under-standing  and  knowledge  about  heart  failure  in  patientswith this condition[41,45-50], but this research was priorto  the  introduction  of  specialist  heart  failure  teams.  Thisresearch  will  provide  information  about  whether  theinformation needs of patients with heart failure are beingmet by the new specialist heart failure nurse services.Competing interestsThe author(s) declare that they have no competing inter-ests.Authors' contributionsKJ  wrote  the  initial  protocol  and  designed  this  study.RCD,  GYHL,  MKD,  JS,  AJS,  JWM  and  SJS  participated  inthe design of the study.
