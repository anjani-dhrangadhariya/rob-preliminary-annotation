The aim of the present study was to evaluate the impact of Probi  Defendum® on aspects of common cold in healthy children 1–6 years of age attending day care.Methods  A total of 131 children, out of the planned 320, were recruited into the study during 1 common cold season and randomised to consume once daily either  109 CFU (colony forming units) of the probiotic product or placebo. Due to unfore-seen reasons, the recruitment of more children did not continue beyond the first cold season.Results  There were 106 children that completed the study out of the 131 randomised. Daily consumption of the probiotic product for a period of 3 months significantly reduced the severity of the symptom “nasal congestion/runny nose” with a mean severity score for the whole study period of 7.5 ± 9.7 in the probiotic group and 13.9 ± 15.2 in the placebo (p &lt; 0.05). Moreover, significantly less concomitant medication was used in the probiotic group. When the data were projected to a larger population corresponding to the originally estimated sample size, the results were in favour of the probiotic group regarding the reduced absence from day care (p &lt; 0.05), reduced mean total severity per day in the reported episodes (p &lt; 0.05) and reduced severity of the symptom “crying more than usual” (p &lt; 0.05).Conclusion  Intake of Probi  Defendum® once daily for a period of 3 months was beneficial to children and reduced the severity of common colds.Keywords  Probiotic · Common cold · Respiratory tract infections · Lactobacillus plantarum · Lactobacillus paracasei · Probi  Defendum®IntroductionProbiotics are live microorganisms which when administered in adequate amounts confer health benefits to the host [1]. Although there is an increasing interest in identifying new areas for possible health benefits from using probiotics, the two main areas for scientific evaluation remain those of gas-trointestinal disorders and modulation of the immune sys-tem. The latter can be evaluated either in diseased or healthy populations using various models for studying the immune  response towards for example vaccination or following an induced or community-acquired infectious disease such as the  common  cold.  When  studying  the  probiotic  benefits at a younger age, it is common to do studies with children attending day care. This is of clinical relevance due to the easier spreading of infections among young children, in this setting, and it is also relevant due to the increased absence from day care/school and work as a result of the infections. The  impact  of  probiotics  against  common  upper  respira-tory tract infections both in adult populations and children has been reviewed and evaluated in multiple meta-analyses [2–4]. There are studies supporting the benefit with probi-otic usage in respiratory tract infections and others reporting negative results.

Moreover,  based  on health-economic analyses, it was reported that probiotics can substantially reduce the socioeconomic burden associated with common upper respiratory tract infections experienced by both adults and children [5, 6]. The combination of Lac-tobacillus plantarum HEAL9 and Lactobacillus paracasei 8700:2 has previously been shown to reduce the incidence, duration and severity of common colds in adults [7, 8]. In the current study, the aim was to confirm the benefit from using the same probiotic product to reduce the incidence of upper respiratory tract infections/common colds (URTIs) in children 1–6 years of age attending day care.MethodsDesign of the studyThe study was randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled with  the  objective  to  evaluate  the  efficacy  of  Lactobacil-lus plantarum HEAL9 and Lactobacillus paracasei 8700:2 as compared to placebo, on the incidence of upper respira-tory tract infections (URTIs) in children attending day care. Focus was on viral acute infections of the upper respiratory tract, i.e. common cold infections. The trial was approved by the Ethical Review Board in Uppsala, Sweden, and was registered  at  ClinicalTrials.gov  (number  NCT01935986) prior to study start. Informed consent forms signed by the caregivers were collected before randomization of the chil-dren into one of the two study groups. The recruitment was initiated in September 2013 and by the end of the common cold season 2013–2014, there were 131 children randomised out of 193 screened. The recruitment was paused during the summer months with the aim to be continued in the follow-ing  season  of  2014–2015.  However,  due  to  closedown  of the  clinical  research  organization  (CRO),  the  recruitment of  more  study  participants  did  not  continue  after  the  first common cold season and the total number of children ran-domised remained at 131.Sample sizeBased on previous data from clinical studies with the same probiotic product in adults [7, 8], it was estimated that 40% of the subjects in the active group compared to 60% in the placebo would experience at least one URTI. The calcula-tion  of  sample  size  was,  therefore,  based  on  an  estimated difference of 20 percent-units between the probiotic group and the placebo in the incidence of URTIs. Assuming a 30% drop-out rate, an alpha level of 0.05 and a power of 80%,  160 subjects were needed in each study group. However, as mentioned above, due to unforeseen reasons, the recruitment was not completed, and the study was terminated after 131 children had been recruited.Study participantsHealthy children of both genders at the age of 1–6 years old, attending day care and whose caregivers had given a signed informed consent were eligible for participation in the study. Exclusion criteria were significant illness (including com-mon cold) within the 2 weeks prior to intervention or any active  systemic  infection  or  medical  condition  that  might require  treatment  or  therapeutic  intervention  during  the study, history of severe allergic reactions or anaphylaxis or any allergy to compounds of the investigational product to an extent that would jeopardize the subject or the study purpose as judged by the investigator, treatment with immune modu-latory or stimulating medication or botanicals/herbal supple-ments (e.g. Echinacea) within 4 weeks before randomization in the study, antibiotic treatment 30 days before randomiza-tion, a history or current signs of perennial allergic rhinitis or  asthma,  influenza  vaccination  within  3  months  before the start of the intervention, caregiver/caregivers smoking at home, regular consumption of probiotics as food supple-ments in the past 3 months before randomization, regular consumption of probiotics or probiotic fermented milk in 4  weeks  prior  to  randomization,  participation  in  another clinical trial during the last 4 weeks prior to the beginning of this study, incapability to comply with the study procedures, any  other  reason  which  in  the  opinion  of  the  Investigator might either put the subject at risk because of participation in the study or influence the results or the subject’s ability to participate in the study.Study proceduresThe  study  was  advertised  in  the  local  communities  and  a pre-screening was done electronically. The parents answered questions related to the inclusion and exclusion criteria that determined  the  eligibility  of  their  children  for  participa-tion in the study. A physical screening visit was booked for collection of the signed informed consent and for confirm-ing  the  compliance  to  the  inclusion/exclusion  criteria.  A 2-week-long  run-in  period  followed,  during  which  intake of other products containing added live bacterial cultures was not allowed. The caregivers were provided with a list of the products to be avoided. They were also instructed how to daily fill in an electronic study diary about their child’s health and presence or absence from day care, starting in the last week of the run-in period and continuing until the end of the study. Caregivers were asked to daily evaluate if their child was ill or not and for every day the child was “feeling </pre>

A second study visit was sched-uled at the end of the run-in period and the children were randomly assigned to consume either the probiotic product or placebo. The third and final visit at the clinic was approx-imately  12  weeks  after  the  start  of  intervention.  Adverse Events spontaneously reported by the subjects, observed or elicited based on non-leading questions by the investigator or medical personnel were collected from the time of signing the informed consent until completion of the study.Investigational productThe active investigational product (IP) consisted of the two probiotic bacterial strains Lactobacillus plantarum HEAL9 (DSM 15312) and Lactobacillus paracasei 8700:2 (DSM 13434).  Each  bacterial  strain  was  equally  represented  in the total bacterial dose of 1 × 109 CFU/sachet. The placebo was of identical appearance, taste and texture as the active product with the bacteria excluded. The IP was supplied in sachets containing a powder of freeze-dried bacteria and/or  maltodextrin  as  filler.  The  powder  was  to  be  dissolved in 100 ml of water or other cold drink and consumed pref-erably  at  breakfast,  once  daily  for  the  total  length  of  the study (90 days). The children were randomly allocated to receive probiotic product or placebo based on a computer-generated  randomization  list  with  blocks  of  four.  Sealed envelopes were prepared for the allocation concealment and were safely stored by the principal investigator, throughout the study. The labelling of the study product and the prepara-tion of the sealed code envelopes was done by employees at Probi not otherwise involved in any study-related activities.OutcomesThe primary objective of the study was to show the ben-efit from using the probiotic combination as compared to placebo, on the incidence of upper respiratory infections during the intervention period of 90 days. Incidence was defined  as  the  number  of  children  repor ting  at  least  one infection.  The  secondar y  endpoints  included  the  evalu-ation  of  the  probiotic  impact,  in  comparison  to  placebo, on  the  number  of  days  with  absence  from  day  care  due to  URTIs  as  well  as  the  duration  and  the  severity  of  the documented URTIs. The assessment of both the primary and  secondar y  endpoints  was  based  on  the  infor mation provided  by  the  caregivers  through  the  electronic  study diar y  that  was  filled  in  daily  for  the  total  length  of  the study. The severity of the reported URTIs was evaluated by  means  of  the  validated  Canadian  Acute  Respirator y Illness and Flu Scale (CARIFS) consisting of not only 18 items  including  illness-specific  questions  but  also  items  related  to  the  social  behaviour  and  general  mood  of  the child [9]. The start of a URTI episode was defined as the first of at least 2 days in a row with at least two symptoms scored  above  0,  whereas  the  end  was  defined  as  the  last day with symptoms followed by at least 2 subsequent days with 0 score.Statistical analysisDescriptive statistics (number of observations, minimum and maximum values and standard deviation or standard error of the mean when this is specified) were used and evaluated using Fisher’s exact test for the analysis of the categorical endpoints, whereas Mann–Whitney U test/Wilcoxon rank sum test was applied for the analysis of the continuous vari-ables. Statistical calculations were performed using StatXact Version 10.1 and all presented p values are nominal, i.e. not adjusted for multiplicity. A p value less than 5% is consid-ered statistically significant.The predefined main analysis set included subjects with no major protocol deviations (as evaluated before breaking the randomization code) and a compliance of at least 80% intake of study product (PP population). However, data on the primary endpoint, incidence of common cold episodes, are also presented for the intention to treat (ITT) population. In addition, a theoretical projection of the obtained results, to the aimed number of approximately 300 participants, was applied using each participant three times. It was assumed that the difference between the groups remained the same in the population of 300 children as obtained in the population of 99. Data on safety are presented for the ITT population only.ResultsAs presented in Fig. 1, 131 healthy children were recruited during one common cold season and were randomly allo-cated to receive either probiotic product (63) or placebo (68). There  were  no  ongoing  colds  at  the  time  of  recruitment. In total, 25 children discontinued the study (11.4%) mostly due to parental withdrawal of informed consent. There were 106  children  who  completed  the  study,  48  (76.2%)  in  the probiotic and 58 (85.3%) in the placebo group. Out of these, 7  presented  with  major  protocol  deviations  and  44  in  the probiotic compared to 55 in the placebo group were found to be eligible for inclusion in the PP population. The two study groups did not differ at baseline regarding gender and age (Table 1). The mean age of the children in both groups was 3.1 ± 1.4 years and the majority were younger than 5 years old.</pre>

In  the  probiotic  group,  34  out  of  44  children  (77.3%)  reported  69  URTIs  in  total  compared  to 44 out of 55 children (78.2%) in the placebo group report-ing 62 infections. Furthermore, there were no differences between  the  treatment  groups  regarding  the  incidence  of common colds neither in the ITT population nor in the age subgroups. Although the study focused on viral acute infec-tions of the upper respiratory tract, there were three children in the probiotic group and four children in the placebo with reported  usage  of  antibiotics  because  of  symptoms  in  the upper airways.Absence from day care due to sicknessIntake  of  the  probiotic  product  resulted  in  less  days  with absence  from  day  care  as  compared  to  intake  of  placebo with  a  mean  of  1.7 ± 2.7  and  2.4 ± 3.5  days,  respectively (p = 0.2). Although the difference was not statistically sig-nificant between the groups in the current study population, the projected data showed that a significance in favour of the probiotic would have been obtained in a similar population of 300 children (p = 0.026).Duration of URTIsThere was no significant difference between the treatment groups regarding the mean duration of the reported URTIs overall  in  the  study  (6.2  days  in  the  probiotic  group  and 5.8  days  in  the  placebo)  or  for  the  first  and  second  epi-sodes. However, the third episode was significantly shorter in  the  probiotic  group  compared  to  the  placebo  group (4.0 ± 2.2 days and 6.6 ± 2.8 days, respectively (p = 0.023). There were 8 children in the probiotic and 15 in the placebo group that experienced a third episode.Fig. 1   Study flowchartTable 1   Baseline characteristics (ITT population)Total Probi  Defendum® PlaceboChildren randomised, n (%) 131 (100) 63 (48.1) 68 (51.9)Males, n (%) 75 (57.2) 32 (50.8) 43 (63.2)Females, n (%) 56 (42.7) 31 (49.2) 25 (36.8)Age in years. mean (SD) 3.1 ± 1.4 3.1 ± 1.4 3.1 ± 1.4 1–2 years old, n (%) 48 (36.6) 24 (38.1) 24 (35.3) 3–4 years old, n (%) 54 (41.2) 24 (38.1) 29 (42.6) 5–6 years old, n (%) 30 (22.9) 15 (23.8) 15 (22.1)Table 2   Number  of  children  with  URTIs  in  the  PP  and  ITT  popula-tions, n (%) Probi  Defendum® Placebo pPP, n (%) 44 55At least 1 episode 34 (77.3) 43 (78.2) 1 &gt; 1 episode 22 (50.0) 23 (41.8) NS &gt; 2 episodes 8 (20.4) 15 (27.3) NS &gt; 3 episodes 1 (2.3) 4 (7.3) NSITT, n (%) 63 68At least 1 episode 41 (65) 47 (69.1) 0.7 &gt; 1 episode 21 (33.3) 23 (33.8) NS &gt; 2 episodes 10 (15.8) 15 (22.8) NS &gt; 3 episodes 1 (1.6) 4 (5.9) NS</pre>

          <pre id="s5v1">413European Journal of Nutrition (2020) 59:409–417  1 3Severity of URTIsThe  validated  questionnaire  CARIFS  was  applied  for measur ing  the  sever ity  of  the  repor ted  common  colds. The mean total severity measured per day in the reported episodes  was  lower  in  the  probiotic  group  as  compared to the placebo (6.5 ± 3.8 and 8.0 ± 5.5, respectively, non-signif icant  difference)  (Fig.  2).  Projecting  the  data  to the  intended  sample  size  of  300  children,  the  difference between the groups became significant (p = 0.034). Analy-sis of the individual items included in CARIFS revealed a significant difference between the groups, already among the 99 children included in the actual PP population, for  severity  of  the  symptom  “nasal  congestion/r unny  nose” (p = 0.024), as presented in Table 3. Furthermore, project-ing the data showed significant reduction by the probiotic, also for the severity of the item “crying more than usual” (p = 0.0037). In addition, in the projected data, an almost significant difference was observed for the item “clingy” that seemed to be improved in the probiotic as compared to the placebo group (p = 0.051). There were no significant differences between the treatment groups for the remaining 15 items in CARIFS based on the actual or the projected data.Adverse eventsThere was no difference between the two study groups in the incidence of AEs (Table 4). There were 35 children in the probiotic group and 32 in placebo who reported at least 1 AE. Most of the children reported only 1 AE, whereas 9 and 14 children in the probiotic and placebo group, respec-tively, reported more than 1 AE. As presented in Table 5, t here  were  signif icantly  more  gastrointestinal-related AEs in the probiotic group as compared to placebo which seemed  primarily  to  be  driven  by  the  higher  number  of cases  with  vomiting.  There  were  eight  AEs  in  total  that were rated as possibly related to the treatment. Three of these were reported in the placebo (diarrhoea, flatulence, loose stools), whereas five were reported in the probiotic group (diar rhoea, flatulence, loose stools, stomach pain, gastroenteritis). All eight cases were considered mild or moderate.012345678910 Probi Defendum® Placebo Mean severity score*p=0.26#p=0.03Fig. 2   Mean  total  severity  score  per  day  in  the  episode  based  on CARIFS  data  for  the  subjects  that  had  at  least  one  URTI  (SEM), *Wilcoxon rank sum test with data from the current study population, #Wilcoxon rank sum test with data projected to a larger populationTable 3   Mean severity score for selected symptoms during the entire study, for subjects that had at least one URTI (SD) *Wilcoxon rank sum test# Projected data to 300 participants Probi  Defendum® n = 34 Placebo n = 43 p* p*#CARIFS item “nasal congestion/runny nose” 7.5 (9.7) 13.9 (15.2) 0.024 0.0001CARIFS item “crying more than usual” 1.9 (3.5) 4.0 (7.2) 0.097 0.004CARIFS item “clingy” 3.9 (6.8) 5.4 (10.3) 0.265 0.051Table 4   Incidence of reported adverse events (ITT population) *Fischer’s exact test Total (n = 106) Probi  Defendum® (n = 63) Placebo (n = 68) p*Subjects with at least one AE, n (%) 67 (51.1) 35 (55.5) 32 (47.1) 0.38Subjects with one AE, n (%) 44 (33.6) 26 (41.3) 18 (26.5) 0.09Subjects with &gt; 1 AE, n (%) 23 (17.5) 9 (14.3) 14 (20.6) 0.36</pre>

The cor responding numbers in the ITT population were 15 subjects in the probiotic group and 25 in the placebo (p = 0.13). Most of the children used con-comitant  medication  due  to  respirator y  tract  infections, but  there  were  also  a  few  cases  associated  with  gastro-intestinal disorders, primarily constipation. Examples of other reasons for medicating included toothache, pinworm infection  and  skin  reaction  due  to  the  paediatric  disease varicella. Overall, there were 62 occasions with concomi-tant medication reported in the study and 48 of these were linked to participants in the placebo. As a result, the mean number  of  medications  used  in  the  PP  population  was 0.3 ± 0.65 in the probiotic group compared to 0.9 ± 1.4 in the placebo (p = 0.018). DiscussionThe  probiotic  impact  on  common  upper  respiratory  tract infections (common cold) has been widely evaluated in ran-domised clinical trials (RCTs) and summarized in multiple reviews and meta-analyses [2, 4, 10, 11]. Common cold is a viral infection occurring frequently in the community. Chil-dren can experience 6–8 colds per year, with the younger children having up to 11 episodes [12], while adults have in average 2–4 colds per year. Although the common cold is  not  a  serious  or  life-threatening  disease,  at  least  not  in healthy populations, it does confer a socioeconomic burden for the individuals and the health care systems. There are multiple probiotic bacteria that have been evaluated for effi-cacy against respiratory tract infections with some examples being Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, Lactobacillus acido-philus  NCFM  and  Bifidobacterium  animalis  subsp.  lactis BB-12 [13–17]. Although there is no doubt that probiotics can reduce the burden of common colds, the strain specific-ity is highlighted. In addition, the age of the study popula-tion, length of intervention and even the formulation may impact the results.Table 5   Frequency of AEs (% of all AEs in the respective treatment group) *Fischer’s exact test# Compared to the total nr of AEs reported in the same groupTotal Probi  Defendum® Placebo p*#Total no. of AEs 97 46 51Gastrointestinal related AEs (%) 61 (62.8) 34 (73.9) 27 (52.9) 0.037 Constipation 5 (5.1) 2 (4.3) 3 (5.9) NS Diarrhoea 5 (5.1) 2 (4.3) 3 (5.9) NS Flatulence 2 (2.1) 1 (2.8) 1 (1.96) NS Loose stools 6 (6.2) 3 (6.5) 3 (5.9) NS Stomach pain 2 (2.1) 2 (4.3) 0 NS Gastroenteritis 30 (30.9) 15 (32.6) 15 (29.4) NS Vomiting 11 (11.3) 9 (19.6) 2 (3.9) 0.092Non-gastrointestinal-related AEs (%) 36 (37.1) 12 (26.1) 24 (47.0) 0.037AEs possibly related to the treatment (%) 8 (8.4) 5 (10.9) 3 (5.9) NSTable 6   Number of children with concomitant medication (PP population) a Percentage of all the subjects in the corresponding groupb Percentage of the subjects, in the corresponding group, with concomitant medication*Fischer’s exact test Total (n = 99) Probi  Defendum® (n = 44) Placebo (n = 55) p*Subjects with any concomitant medication, n (%)a 35 (35.3) 11 (25.0) 24 (43.6) 0.06 RTI-related, n (%)b 28 (80.0) 10 (0.9) 18 (75.0) NS GI-related, n (%)b 2 (5.7) 0 2 (8.3) NS Other reasons, n (%)b 7 (20.0) 4 (36.4) 3 (12.5) NS</pre>

The  study  was  designed  to include 320 children, but the recruitment was unexpectedly stopped when 131 children had been randomised, as already described. The data collected were, therefore, analysed for the actual population in the study and for an identical pro-jected population that was three times larger to approximate the original estimated requirement of 320 children.Intake of Lactobacillus plantarum HEAL9 and Lactoba-cillus paracasei 8700:2 did not prevent the acquisition of upper respiratory tract infections in the study population nor did it reduce the mean duration of the infections compared to that of the placebo. There was, however, a significantly shorter duration of the third cold episode that was reported by 8 children in the probiotic group and 15 children in the placebo. Moreover, there was a reduced absence from day care in the current population with a mean of 1.7 days in the probiotic group compared to 2.4 days in placebo. The differ-ence was significant following projection of the results to a larger population (p = 0.026).Similar  results  were  seen  for  the  severity  score  of  the reported  respiratory  tract  infections.  Mean  total  severity score per day in the episodes was 8.0 in the placebo com-pared  to  6.5  in  the  probiotic  group  (p = 0.226),  a  differ-ence  that  reached  statistical  significance  in  the  projected data (p = 0.034). Interestingly, the individual CARIFS item “nasal congestion/runny nose” was significantly milder in the probiotic group within the actual study population with a mean severity score of 7.5 compared to 13.9 in the placebo (p = 0.024). Moreover, there were trends for reduced sever-ity in the probiotic group also for the items “crying more than usual” and “clingy”, two items of high relevance when evaluating the severity of infections in young children who cannot express themselves verbally.The  benefit  against  common  cold  infections  following intake  of  Lactobacillus  plantarum  HEAL9  and  Lactoba-cillus  paracasei  8700:2  at   109  CFU/day  for  a  period  of  3 months has previously been reported in adult populations [7, 8]. Berggren et al. reported a reduced incidence of common cold infections from 67% in the control group to 55% in the probiotic group (p &lt; 0.05) and a reduction in the number of days with symptoms from 8.6 days in the control to 6.2 days in the participants having consumed the probiotic [7]. There was also a significant reduction in severity of the pharyn-geal symptoms following intervention with the probiotics. In the second RCT in adults evaluating the benefit from using the same probiotic, Busch et al. reported the significantly shorter cold episodes in the probiotic compared to the pla-cebo group (5.6 and 6.7 days, respectively) and a reduced severity  of  the  colds  in  the  probiotic  group  with  9  of  13  evaluated symptoms being significantly reduced compared to the placebo [8].Interestingly,  the  relative  difference  between  the  study groups for the incidence of common colds in the study by Berggren  et  al.  was  larger  the  more  episodes  the  partici-pants were experiencing [7]. This could be compared with the reduced duration of the third episode experienced by the children in the current study, despite the absence of efficacy on the incidence of the colds. Although the observation in the current study is based on a small number of children, it could reflect the ability of the specific combination of two probiotic bacteria to strengthen or prime the immune sys-tem, in a preventative manner, for a more efficient defence against upcoming infections. In the study by Rask et al., it was reported that intake of Lactobacillus paracasei 8700:2 tended to increase the population of natural killer (NK)-T cells  (p = 0.06)  and  also  to  increase  the  expression  of  the memory marker CD45R0 on the surface of CD8+ lympho-cytes  [18].  Intake  of  the  strain  Lactobacillus  plantarum 299v (Lp299v) significantly increased the expression of the activation  marker  CD25  on  the  surface  of  CD8+  T  cells (p = 0.01). In addition, there was an increased phagocytic activity of polymorphonuclear (PMN) leukocytes and mono-cytes isolated from study participants who had consumed either the Lactobacillus paracasei (p = 0.05) or the Lacto-bacillus plantarum strain (p = 0.06) compared to placebo. Lp299v is genetically very similar to  Lactobacillus plan-tarum  HEAL9  (present  in  Probi   Defendum®)  that  could hypothetically  be  expected  to  behave  in  a  similar  way  to Lp299v. The innate cell-mediated immune functions induced by L. paracasei 8700:2 and the activation of T-lymphocytes by L. plantarum in the study by Rask et al. [18] could sup-port  an  anti-viral  activity  and  could  possibly  explain  the mechanism behind the effects seen in the current study and the studies by Berggren et al. [7] and Busch et al. [8].In  the  current  study,  there  was  no  difference  between the study groups regarding incidence and total number of adverse events reported by the children. There were, how-ever,  more  gastrointestinal  adverse  events  reported  in  the probiotic group compared to the placebo which seemed to be explained by the higher frequency of vomiting, a type of adverse event reported also in other studies following admin-istration of probiotics to young children [4]. All the cases with “vomiting” were described as either “not related” or “unlikely related” to the study product.More children reported usage of concomitant medication in the placebo group compared to the probiotic (p = 0.06), primarily  for  respiratory  tract-associated  symptoms.  This could indirectly reflect a reduced severity of the respiratory symptoms  in  the  probiotic  group,  which  is  in  agreement with the significantly reduced severity of the nasal symptom “runny nose”. One could also consider that the higher usage of concomitant medication by the children in the placebo </pre>

A different approach for studying the pro-biotic efficacy in the respiratory tract is the topical appli-cation in the nose using nasal sprays. This application has primarily  been  evaluated  for  the  treatment  of  bacterially caused chronic rhinosinusitis [19, 20] as a means of reduc-ing bacterial complications following a common cold. The possible combination of nasal probiotics with antibiotics has also been discussed for reducing the risk for post-antibiotic nasal colonization by Gram-negative bacteria or Staphylo-coccus aureus. Furthermore, there seems to be a nasal pro-biotic efficacy in allergic rhinitis with supportive evidence primarily for strains of Lactobacillus paracasei [21, 22]. In this latter case, probiotics are considered as a possible adju-vant therapy for the treatment of allergic rhinitis. However, both with chronic rhinosinusitis and allergic rhinitis the aim with the probiotic application has primarily been to treat or counteract the worsening of the existing symptoms which is different from the preventive application of probiotics that has  been  evaluated  in  the  current  study  and  other  studies with naturally acquired or induced common colds.The strength of this study is that although the actual sam-ple size was lower than aimed for, there were still significant differences detected between the study groups in favour of the preventative beneficial usage of the probiotic. A weak-ness, on the other hand, is the unmet efficacy concerning the primary endpoint that was the incidence of common colds. However, when Lactobacillus plantarum HEAL9 and Lac-tobacillus paracasei 8700:2 were evaluated in adults, there was a reduced incidence in one of the studies but not in the other. As already mentioned, this discrepancy could reflect the  difficulties  with  studying  the  probiotic  impact  on  the immune system that is a complex network of many interact-ing parameters. Taken together, the current study provides for  the  first  time  evidence  that  Lactobacillus  plantarum HEAL9  and  Lactobacillus  paracasei  8700:2  reduce  the severity of common colds in children as reflected in symp-tom relief, reduced need for medication during the study and reduced absence from day care due to sickness.Compliance with ethical standards Conflict of interest  Probi AB is the sponsor of this clinical study and the authors of the manuscript are employed by Probi AB or were em-ployed  at  the  time  the  study  was  initiated.
