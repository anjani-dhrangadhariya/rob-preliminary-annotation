This was followed by a home-basedprogramme with home visits at 4, 10 and 20 weeks, tele-phone support at 6, 15 and 24 weeks and a manual.The  home  programme  was  predominantly  aerobic  train-ing based largely on progressive walking with self-comple-tion  activity  logs.  Exercise  prescription  was  based  uponthe  participant's  baseline  exercise  tolerance  as  measuredby  the  incremental  shuttle  walking  test.  Performance  onthis test correlates well with peak VO2 [34,36] An individ-ually prescribed walking programme was identified fromthis test at a speed that corresponded to 70% of peak per-formance. During the first two weeks of rehabilitation thespeed of walking was secured by the patient with the helpof the rehabilitation team. Targets were set weekly for theduration and frequency of walks, which largely dependedon  an  individual's  baseline  exercise  capacity.  The  pro-gramme  aimed  for  the  patients  to  achieve  20  to  30  min-utes  of  walking  5  times  a  week  after  10  weeks  ofrehabilitation.
