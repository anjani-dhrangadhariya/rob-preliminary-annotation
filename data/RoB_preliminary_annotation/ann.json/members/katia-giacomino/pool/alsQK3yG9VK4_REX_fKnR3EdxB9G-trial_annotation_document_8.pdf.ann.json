Assuming a 5% per year dropout rate, 100 randomized participants were required to demonstrate that hydroxyurea reduces the cumulative incidence of conversion to abnormal TCD velocity. Children were randomized at a 1 to 1 ratio and used an adaptive blocked randomization algorithm. The intention-to-treat principle was followed and all eligible, randomized participants were analyzed as randomized, in the primary analysis. As a secondary post-hoc analysis, participants were analyzed according to the actual treatment received (hydroxyurea versus observation), since two children were randomized but did not receive treatment with hydroxyurea due to unavailability of study drug at one site. The exact log-rank test (1-sided) was used to compare the cumulative incidence of conversion to abnormal TCD velocity.
