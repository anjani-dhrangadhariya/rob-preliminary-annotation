It contains 15 items and each item is rated on a5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (never) to 5 (always).A total is calculated by adding all items together to obtaina score ranging from 15 to 75, with higher scores indicat-ing higher levels of hostility and aggression to the child.The psychometric properties of the perceived parentalaggression scale have been empirically tested [33,34],showing adequate reliability and validity.Parental Stress Scale (PSS)The PSS was developed by Berry and Jones [35] to assess aparent’s subjective feelings of strain, difficulty and dissatis-faction in reaction to stressors in the parent–child relation-ship. The PSS consists of 18 items on the perception ofparental stress, using a 5-point Likert scale from 1 to 5 (1 =strongly disagree, 2 = disagree, 3 = somewhat disagree, 4 =agree, 5 = strongly agree). A total is calculated by adding allitems together to obtain a score ranging from 18 to 90, withhigher scores indicating higher levels of parental stress.The psychometric properties of the PSS have been em-pirically tested [35-37], showing good concurrent valid-ity, excellent construct validity and adequate internalconsistency reliability. The Chinese version of the PSShas been translated and used by Cheung [36], the find-ings demonstrating acceptable psychometric propertiesfor researchers to assess stress among Chinese parents."}],"coordinates":[{"x":"304.72","y":"91.55"},{"x":"530.44","y":"612.73"}],"confidence":{"state":"pre-added","who":["user:roger-annotation"],"prob":1},"fields":{},"normalizations":{}},{"classId":"e_188","part":"s5v1","offsets":[{"start":2717,"text":"Self-reported parent–child relationshipThe parent–child relationship of the participants wasmeasured by using a self-reporting method consisting oftwo items, with one asking “How satisfied are you withthe parent–child relationship?” and the other ‘As a parent,how satisfied are you with yourself?’ Each item is rated ona 6-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (total unsatisfactory)to 6 (total satisfactory).
