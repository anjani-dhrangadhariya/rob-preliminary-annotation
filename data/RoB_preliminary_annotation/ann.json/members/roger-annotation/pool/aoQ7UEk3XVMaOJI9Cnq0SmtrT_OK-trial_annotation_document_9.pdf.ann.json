Body composition was measured by dual X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) (Monash Health Radiology, Melbourne). Body mass index (BMI) was calculated from weight (kg)/square of height (m), and waist and hip circumferences were used to establish the waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) as an additional index for body fat distribution (waist (mm)/hip (mm) = WHR). Participants completed vali-dated questionnaires assessing self-reported sun exposure habits, physical activity (International Physical Activity Questionnaire)31, and diet (3-day food record; Foodworks 8.0 Professional, Xyris Software, Australia).Blood Sample Analyses.  Fasting venous blood samples were drawn at baseline, and then after the 16-week inter-vention using standard phlebotomy techniques into serum separation vacutainers for measurement of serum inflammatory markers and 25(OH)D concentrations, respectively. All blood samples were analyzed under blinded conditions using standard quality control systems (all results within ± 2 SD). Serum 25(OH)D and hsCRP were measured by an accredited and quality-assured laboratory (Monash Health Pathology, Melbourne). Serum 25(OH)D was measured using direct competitive chemiluminescent immunoassays (CLIA) (DiaSorin Inc., MN, USA) with inter- and intra-assay coefficients of variation (CVs) of <10% and <4%, respectively. Plasma high sensitivity CRP (hsCRP) was measured by highly sensitive near-infrared particle immunoassay rate methodol-ogy on a Synchron LX system analyzer (Beckman Coulter Inc., Sydney, Australia) according to manufacturer’s instructions. Inter- and intra-assay CVs for hsCRP were <3% and <5%, respectively. Inflammatory markers were measured using a bead-based multi-analyte assay (LEGENDplex™ Human Inflammation panel, Cat. 740118; Biolegend, San Diego, CA). This panel was used to simultaneously quantify 13 pro- and anti- inflammatory cytokines/chemokines including TNF, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), interferon alpha (IFN-α) and gamma (IFN- γ), and IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12, IL-17A, IL-18, IL-23, and IL-33. Serum samples were diluted 2-fold based on preliminary testing and the kit-specified protocol was performed on 96-well v-bottom plates as follows. Sonicated pre-mixed beads, serum samples, cytokine standards, and detection antibodies were added to each well and then plates were incubated (in the dark) on a plate shaker at 600 rpm for 2 hours at room temperature (RT). Following incubation, streptavidin–phycoerythrin (SA-PE) solution was added to each well and further incubated on a plate shaker for 30 min at RT. The conjugated beads were then centrifuged (1000 g, 5 minutes, RT) and pelleted, and resuspended in wash buffer before being transferred to mini FACS tubes for data acquisition. Data acquisition was performed using the BD™ LSR II flow cytometer and FACS DIVA software set up as per manufacturer’s instructions (Becton Dickinson, San Diego, CA). Data were analyzed using the LEGENDplex™ Data Analysis Software (BioLegend, San Diego, CA) with standard curves generated from 0 to 50,000 pg/ml, and samples adjusted for the dilution factors. Inter- and intra-assay CVs for all analytes were <8% and <9%, respectively.
