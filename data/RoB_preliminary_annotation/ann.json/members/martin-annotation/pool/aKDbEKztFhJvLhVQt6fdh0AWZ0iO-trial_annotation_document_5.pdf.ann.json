Categorical data are reported by number of subjects and percentage.Comparisons between the initial radiofrequency treatment group and the placebo group weremade with unpaired t-tests or Mann-Whitney U test. Since the continuous data in each grouphad a normal distribution, comparisons between and within the initial radiofrequency andcrossover treatment groups were made with two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA).
